ADVANCED: Create multiple connections to a Benchmark
====================================================

Sometimes it is useful to have only a single container instance running for multiple experiments.
For example if starting a container is very expensive.

Since version 0.0.8, we can now start a benchmark container in a background process and connect to the benchmark from
various other processes.
This example shows how to create a benchmark and create a separate proxy connection to it.

The benchmark is based on Pyro4 and should handle a certain amount of simultaneous calls.

Also make sure not have to many open Pyro4.Proxy connections.
(See https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tipstricks.html#after-x-simultaneous-proxy-connections-pyro-seems-to-freeze-fix-release-your-proxies-when-you-can)

Please install the necessary dependencies via ``pip install .`` and singularity (v3.5).
